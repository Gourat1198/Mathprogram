The python code is just a side project, for me to develop my skills in python. So basically the program is intented to request an input from the user, stating the kind of operation he/she want to perform e.g inputing matrix to perform an operation relating to linear algebra. A more detailed diagram will be at the footer of this README, I used alot of IF statement to set out precise conditions for python to follow, if no conditions where met, and ELSE statement will ask the user to input an available operation
