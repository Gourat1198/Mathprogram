# Python Mathematical Program

*This is a mathematical program, that require discrete input from the user, such as but not limited to (addition,matrix,vector-sum,mutliplication and many more). This program aims to support the user by handling simple but complex calculations. It serves as my introductory project to Python programming.*

## List of Operations

*The table below shows the list of operation thats is available in the program.*

| Operation         | Description                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Addition          | Adds two numbers                                 |
| Matrix            | Performs matrix operations like determinant      |
| Vector Sum        | Calculates the sum of vectors                    |
| Multiplication    | Multiplies two numbers                           |
| Division          | Divides one number by another                    |
| Power             | Raises a number to the power of another number   |
| Modulus           | Finds the modulus of two numbers                 |

### How to Run the Program

#### Ensure you have Python installed on your system

Run the following command to check if python is installed in your system.

```

python --version 
```

1. If the output is detailing a python version, the you have python installed.
2. If there is no output,an error code in red or an output saying that a program named python is neither installed or available. Click [install](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

#### Navigate to the project directory in your terminal

use the cd command to change the directory to  /src

#### Run the program using the following command

Run this command in your terminal

   ```
   python mathprogram.py
   ```

You should see the output:

```
which operation will you like to perform, please input the operation name in full, e.g addition for (+):
