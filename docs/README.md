# A Python Mathematical Program

*This is a passion project designed to fuel my curiosity in Python. In mid-2024, I started my journey with Python as part of the skills required for the proper completion of my bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering. This project is a mathematical program developed to provide solutions to high school-level mathematics questions.*
